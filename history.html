        <p>
            Founded in 1983 by four men, Lambda Theta Delta is UC Irvine's premier Asian-American fraternity dedicated to the 
            personal development of each individual member, 
            fostering the ideals of friendship, leadership, scholarship, service, and cultural awareness. 
            Since its inception at the UCI over two decades ago Lambda Theta Delta has initiated over 500 members, 
            recently growing into a respected and influential organization both at UCI and in the surrounding Southern California area. 
            Our combination of both unity and diversity gives Lambda Theta Delta its strength and character.
