                    Rush happens in week 1 of the Fall and Winter quarter, with bids being offered at the end of the week. 
                    Rush is important for us to get to know you as a person and more importantly, for you to see if we're the right fit.
                    Over the course of the week, rushees have multiple interactions with current members, sister sororities, fellow rushees and get
                    to meet the alumni during alumni night to get some insight into their life after being part of the fraternity.
                    Don't be shy! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find out more about the program after accepting the bid in our "Program" page.
